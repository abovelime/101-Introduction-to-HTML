# Introduction
Hello! Welcome to the first lesson of HTML! You should know the basics, such as making headings and paragraphs, but today we are diving deeper into the other special tags, like buttons and divs
# Divs
The point of a div is to be able to style an area or space whatever is inside the div. To do this, you need to use CSS. We will learn that later and this div knowledge is really useful. To make a div, you can make it before you put anything inside it, just make a "div" tag and a "/div" tag to end it. If you have stuff that you want in it, but haven't made it yet, just wrap your text in those tags. For refrence, check the div.html example in this repository.
