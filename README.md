# Introduction
Hello! Welcome to the first lesson of HTML! You should know the basics, such as making headings and paragraphs, but today we are diving deeper into the other special tags, like buttons and divs
# Divs
The point of a div is to be able to style an area or space whatever is inside the div. To do this, you need to use CSS. We will learn that later and this div knowledge is really useful. To make a div, you can make it before you put anything inside it, just make a "div" tag and a "/div" tag to end it. If you have stuff that you want in it, but haven't made it yet, just wrap your text in those tags.
# Buttons & 'Special Tags'
Buttons are mainly used for calling commands and doing something on a click. In another lesson, we will learn about JavaScript, which will dive deep into functions and how to make a button do something. To make a button, you need a tag 'button' and '/button'. A special tag can be added in the first tag, and modifies the item. You can add CSS to just the item, call functions on clicks, which is what we are going to look at soon and, espcially for divs, add a classifier so we know how to call the div. There's 2 types, one for JavaScript which can be used for any item, called ID, and one for div's called class. This is special for div's. We won't be diving into any of them until we get to CSS or JavaScript, so look out for those classes. Now, add a special tag inside the 'button' tag at the front of your button, (as shown in the refrence) called onclick="(FUNCTION)". DONT ADD ANYTHING INSIDE OF THIS. We will dive into that when we do the JavaScript Task. We will also dive into more HTML elements in class 102.
# Refrences
Check the files inside the main branch for refrences to anything mentioned here. For the div's, anything I have said or done was marked in the div.html file and anything in the Buttons and Special Tags section is marked in the b-st.html file.
# Your Work
Fork this repository by clicking the fork button in the corner and make a new file called assignment.html
In this file, make a document containing the following:

A Title (the one on the tabs menu at the top of the browser)

A heading

A Button wrapped in a div and that contains the onclick="" special tag with nothing inside of it.

Thank you!
